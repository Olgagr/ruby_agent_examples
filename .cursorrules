Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, idiomatic Ruby code with accurate examples.
- Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., user_signed_in?, calculate_total).

Naming Conventions

- Use snake_case for file names, method names, and variables.
- Use CamelCase for class and module names.

Syntax and Formatting

- Follow the Ruby Style Guide (https://rubystyle.guide/)
- Use Ruby's expressive syntax (e.g., unless, ||=, &.)
- Prefer single quotes for strings unless you need interpolation.

Error Handling and Validation

- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages.
